vertx-js
========

Tests TODO:

1. Test that vertice is deployed as common JS module and has all the correct fields (module, exports etc)
2. Test that start and stop are called properly
3. Implement async start and stop (maybe can pass in a function as a variable to the script)
4. Test all the different types of constructs in the API.
5. Test the docs are generated properly
